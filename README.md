# theft-paper
Source code for analysis in the the paper which introduces the theft R package

## Notes

This is a small repository which just holds a single `R` script for the code to reproduce the results and graphics presented in my new paper [Feature-Based Time-Series Analysis in R using the theft Package](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06146). Most of the code is presented throughout the paper itself, but the script `the-theft-package-for-R.R` is a self-contained code-only summary. Note that to run the analysis, you require the [Bonn EEG](https://ebrary.net/59044/education/details_public_databases) dataset.
